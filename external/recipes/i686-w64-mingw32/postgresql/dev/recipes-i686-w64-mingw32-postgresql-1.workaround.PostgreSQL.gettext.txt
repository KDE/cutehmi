Problem:

Even if PostgreSQL is configured with `-enable-thread-safety` option and
PQisthreadsafe() returns 1, when two (or more) threads attempt to open database
connection in parallel _libpq_ library causes a crash on Windows.

Investigation:

The crash is caused precisely by call to libpq_gettext() in pqWaitTimed()
function (file: `fe-misc.c`). It comes out that _gettext_ functions are not
thread-safe on Windows, thus all other pieces of code, where gettext has been
used may be affected.

Workaround:

A workaround is to disable NLS (native language support), which effectively
turns off _gettext_.

Snippet:
