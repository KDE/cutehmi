Problem:

Clang (version 6.0) fails to compile the code giving error message `undefined reference to
cutehmi::dataacquisition::internal::EventCollective::ColumnValues::~ColumnValues()` and similar for other "collective" classes as if
it deleted a destructor instead of providing implicit one.

Investigation:

This is most probably related to clang bug 28280:
https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28280
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58339496/undefined-reference-to-a-destructor-in-clang

Workaround:

Workaround is to prvide a destructor explicitly.

Snippet:
