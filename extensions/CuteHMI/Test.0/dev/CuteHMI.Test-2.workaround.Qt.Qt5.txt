Problem:

In Qt 6.0 the return type of containers size() function has been changed from `int` to `qsizetype`. This leads to template argument
deduction failure due to ambiguity as one of the parameters is `qsizetype` and the other one is `int`.

Workaround:

Workaround is to use static_cast to disambiguate.
