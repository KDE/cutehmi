Problem:

Component State from Qt declarative state machine framework (QtQml.StateMachine)
prints warning "No top level StateMachine found. Nothing will run without a
StateMachine" if it is not enclosed in some state machine.

Investigation:

Code that triggers the warning can be found in
`qtdeclarative/src/imports/statemachine/state.cpp` file:

```
void State::componentComplete()
{
    if (this->machine() == nullptr) {
        static bool once = false;
        if (!once) {
            once = true;
            qmlWarning(this) << "No top level StateMachine found.  Nothing will run without a StateMachine.";
        }
    }
}
```

Workaround:

Workaround is to use surrogate state machine until configureXYZ() function are
called and the state is reparented to the destination state machine.

Snippet:
