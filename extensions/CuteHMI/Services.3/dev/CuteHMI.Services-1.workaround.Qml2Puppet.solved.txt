Problem:

Qml2Puppet can not handle indefinitely recursive properties.

Workaround:

Workaround is to detect if current application is Qml2Puppet and return nullptr if so.

Snippet:

Solution:

Recursive properties can be troublesome not only for Qml2Puppet, but for various tools, which inspect properties. Additionaly
approach used by PollingTimer class does not seem to stand to KISS principle. For these reasons PollingTimer class has been entirely
removed.
