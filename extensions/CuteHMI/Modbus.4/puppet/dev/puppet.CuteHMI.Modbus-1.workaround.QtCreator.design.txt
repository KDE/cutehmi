Problem:

QtCreator uses '*Specifics.qml' files, which import HelperWidgets to display various properties of QML items "Design" mode. The
probelm is that provided LineEdit does not display 'placeholderText' any more, which was a way to display binding expression for a
given property.

Investigation:

QtCreator uses custom styling of LineEdit/TextField which is based on QtQuick.Templates 2.0 component. Placeholder text was probably
meant to be displayed as part of a 'background', but TextFiled provided by StudioComponents uses plain Rectangle for a background.

Workaround:

Workaround is to hide LineEdit and use associated Label to display binding expression.

Snippet:
