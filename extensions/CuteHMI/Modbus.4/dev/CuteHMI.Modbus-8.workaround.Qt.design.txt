Problem:

Signal QModbusServer::dataWritten() uses `int` for size parameter. As such it
might be to small to be safely converted to `quint16` parameters used by
QtServerBackend signals.

Workaround:

Because `size` can not exceed maximal theoretical amount of registers that
can be queried at once (2008 coils through RTU) it should be safe to cast
`int` to `quint16`.

Snippet:
