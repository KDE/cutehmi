Problem:

QModbusDataUnit constructor accepts 'size' parameter as quint16, which makes it
impossible to cover extended address space of Modbus with 65536 registers
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus).

Workaround:

Workaround is to use a constructor, wich accepts QVector as 'data' parameter and
fill it with desired number of registers.

Snippet:

Solution:

QModbusDataUnit has been replaced by internal data containers.
