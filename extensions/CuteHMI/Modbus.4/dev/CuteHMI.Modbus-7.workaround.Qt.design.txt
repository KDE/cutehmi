Problem:

QModbusDataUnit::setValue() function accepts `int` type as its `index` parameter,
while functions such as QModbusDataUnit::valueCount() use `uint`
as return type. It may be not safe to access container elements through index
type, which covers smaller range than type used to determine container size.

Workaround:

Because valueCount() can not exceed maximal theoretical amount of registers that
can be queried at once (2008 coils through RTU) it is safe to downcast returned
`uint` value to `int`, which is guaranteed to be at least 16 bit wide.

Snippet:
