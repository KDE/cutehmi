 * %Serviceable interface. By implementing this interface object is allowed to be embedded inside Service instance.
 *
 * Implementing Serviceable interface involves configuring states and defining transitions. During configuration state interface
 * can be extended by adding additional child states to the states passed by configuration functions.
 *
 * Standard states and transitions are shown on the following state chart diagram.
 * @image html doc/standard_states.png "State interface"
 * @image latex doc/standard_states.png "State interface"
 *
 * Implementing object can utilize the state machine according to its needs by:
 *		- defining when standard transitions take place (and likely trigger them)
 *		- adding custom states to the standard ones
 *		- connecting slots to QState signals (custom or standard ones)
 *		.
