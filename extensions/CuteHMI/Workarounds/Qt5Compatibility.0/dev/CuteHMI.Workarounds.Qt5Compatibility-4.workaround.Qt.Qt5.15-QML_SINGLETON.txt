Problem:

In Qt 5.15 when registering type with QML_SINGLETON the class must have default constructor (thus not be a real singleton). Qt6 and
later versions can obtain singleton instance with static create() method. Because of that Qt5.15 must still partially rely on
qmlRegisterSingletonType() function and QQmlExtensionPlugin can not be dropped in favor of QQmlEngineExtensionPlugin, when
singletons are registered by the extension.

Workaround:

Workaround is to use separate code branches for Qt 6 and Qt 5.15 until Qt 5.15 is supported.

Snippet:
