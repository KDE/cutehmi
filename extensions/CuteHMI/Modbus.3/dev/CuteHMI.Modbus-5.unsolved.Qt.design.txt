Problem:

Signal QModbusServer::dataWritten() uses `int` for address type. On systems, 
where `int` is 16 bit wide it will fail to cover whole Modbus address range 
(0-65535).

Investigation:

This is inconsistent with for example QModbusServer::data() function, which
righteously uses `quint16` for address type.

Snippet:
