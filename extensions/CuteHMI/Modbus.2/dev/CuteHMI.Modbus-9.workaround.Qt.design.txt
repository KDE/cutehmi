Problem:

QModbusDataUnit::dataWritten() signal accepts `int` type as its `size` parameter,
whilQModbusDataUnit::valueCount() uses `uint` as return type. As such it is
incompatible with `size` parameter, which might not be able to represent all
returned values.

Workaround:

Because valueCount() can not exceed maximal theoretical amount of registers that
can be queried at once (2008 coils through RTU) it should be safe to cast
returned `uint` value to `int`, which is guaranteed to be at least 16 bit wide.

Snippet:
