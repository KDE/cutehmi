## AbstractDevice API

AbstractDevice uses JSON objects for requests and replies.

Using JSON instead of full blown objects has an advantage for an API to be light-weight, flexible and it fits naturally into
QML/JavaScript. The drawbacks may seem to be a performance overhead, but JSON objects are implicitly shared in Qt, so it should not
be a problem in most cases. Another problem is type safety, but this can be compensated with validation and sanitization.
JSON-based API also offers interesting possibilities in terms of forwarding it to web REST API.

Resolution: positive.

## Request id

AbstractDevice uses strings generated by QUuid class for request ids.

The rationale was that requests may be stored in database or logs and that multiple instances of application may share these data
stores. The request could be further associated with action of a particular user and in such case id could act as a globally unique
key.

The cost is of course performance. It seems that simple static integer counter would do the job.

Resolution: doubtful.
