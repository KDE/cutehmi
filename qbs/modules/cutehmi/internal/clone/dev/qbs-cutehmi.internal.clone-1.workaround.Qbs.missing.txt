Problem:

Sometimes there is a need to sanitize cloned files (e.g. to modify the names
related to the product). This could be done by associating file tag with a
function callback. Unfortunately Qbs does not provide an easy way to pass a
JavaScript function callback from one module to another. Such callback would be
handy to apply sanitization to the auto-generated files by the module, which is
responsible for generating such file.

Workaround:

Workaround is to simply use hard-coded Javascript function within
cutehmi.internal.clone Qbs module. The function can be put into separate
JavaScript file to mitigate the problem to some extent until proper solution is
found.
