Problem:

Program qmltyperegistrar genereates `*_qmltyperegistrations.cpp` files, which do not take into account that header file with
annotated class resides in a subdirectory. Compilation fails.

Investigation:

The issue is mentioned in Qt bug reports: https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QBS-1579.

Workaround:

Workaround is to add the directory with the header file to include paths. To restrict additional include path to
`*_qmltyperegistrations.cpp` files a Group can be used.
