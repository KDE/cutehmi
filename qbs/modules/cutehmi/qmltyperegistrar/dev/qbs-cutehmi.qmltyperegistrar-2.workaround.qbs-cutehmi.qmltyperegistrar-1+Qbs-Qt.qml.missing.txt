Problem:

Because of qbs-cutehmi.qmltyperegistrar-1 workaround Group is created for `*_qmltyperegistrations.cpp` generated by
qmltyperegistrar. These files are annotated by "Qt.qml" module with "cpp" and "unmocable" tags. A more specific file tag would be
welcomed.

Workaround:

Currently "unmocable" file tag is used.
